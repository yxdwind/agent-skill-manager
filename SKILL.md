## Adding New Products

Edit `src/agent_skill_manager/products.py` and add to the `PRODUCTS` list:

```python
{
    "name": "New Product",
    "short": "newprod",
    "macos_path": HOME / ".newproduct" / "skills",
    "windows_path": HOME / ".newproduct" / "skills",
    "sync_method": "symlink",
    "note": "Description",
    "extra_dirs_macos": [],
    "extra_dirs_windows": [],
}
```

## Architecture

All skills live in `~/.agents/skills/` (the emerging universal standard). 
The `askill sync` command creates symlinks (macOS) or junctions (Windows) 
to each product's skill directory.

```
~/.agents/skills/          ← Central Repository
  └── my-skill/
      └── SKILL.md
           │
           ├── junction → ~/.openclaw/skills/my-skill/
           ├── junction → ~/.config/agents/skills/my-skill/
           ├── junction → ~/.workbuddy/skills/my-skill/
           ├── junction → ~/.trae/skills/my-skill/
           ├── junction → ~/.codebuddy/skills/my-skill/
           ├── junction → ~/.comate/skills/my-skill/
           └── junction → ~/.qoderwork/skills/my-skill/
```
